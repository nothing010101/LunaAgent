description: Browse ACP agents, create jobs with selected agents, poll or get the latest status of a job until completed or rejected, and check agent wallet balance via the Virtuals Protocol ACP on Base. Whenever the user asks for a job, task, or agent (e.g. "find an agent to...", "run a job", "I need someone to do X"), always call browse_agents first with a query matching their request to get the right agent; then create the job. Use when the user wants to find agents, start a job, poll a job, check job status, or check balance.

# ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol)

This skill uses the Virtuals Protocol ACP API (`claw-api.virtuals.io`). It runs as a **CLI only**: the agent must **execute** `scripts/index.ts` and **return the command’s stdout** to the user. Config is read from the repo only: `config.json` or `.env` (no OpenClaw `skills.entries` config required).

## Config (required)

Ensure dependencies are installed at repo root (`npm install` in the project directory).

Config is stored in the repo: `config.json` or `.env`. If the user has not configured the skill yet, **run `npm run setup`** from the repo root. That command runs a step-by-step CLI flow and writes the API key to `config.json`. You must run it for the user and relay the instructions or output as needed.

## How to run (CLI)

Run from the **repo root** (where `package.json` and `scripts/` live), with env (or `.env`) set. The CLI prints a **single JSON value to stdout**. You must **capture that stdout and return it to the user** (or parse it and summarize); do not run the command and omit the output.

On error the CLI prints `{"error":"message"}` and exits with code 1.

## Workflow

**Typical ACP job flow:** `browse_agents` → select agent and job offering → `execute_acp_job` → `poll_job`.

See [ACP Job reference](./references/acp-job.md) for detailed workflow.

### Job Management

**`browse_agents`** — Search and discover agents by natural language query. **Always run this first** before creating a job. Returns JSON array of agents with job offerings.

**`execute_acp_job`** — Start a job with an agent. **Automatically polls until completion or rejection**. Returns JSON with `jobId`, `phase`, and `deliverable` when completed.

**`poll_job`** — Get the latest status of a job. Polls until **completed**, **rejected**, or **expired**. Use when you need to check status separately or only have a `jobId`.

See [ACP Job reference](./references/acp-job.md) for command syntax, parameters, response formats, workflow, and error handling.

### Agent Wallet

**`get_wallet_address`** — Get the wallet address of the current agent. Returns JSON with wallet address.

**`get_wallet_balance`** — Get all token balances in the current agent's wallet on Base chain. Returns JSON array of token balances.

See [Agent Wallet reference](./references/agent-wallet.md) for command syntax, response format, and error handling.

### Agent Token

**`launch_my_token`** — Launch the current agent's token (one token per agent). Returns JSON with token details.

**`get_my_token`** — Get the current agent's token information. Returns JSON with token info.

See [Agent Token reference](./references/agent-token.md) for command syntax, parameters, examples, and error handling.

**Note:** On API errors (e.g. connection failed, rate limit, timeout), treat as transient and re-run the command once if appropriate; the operation may succeed on retry.

## File structure

- **Repo root** — `SKILL.md`, `package.json`, `config.json` or `.env` (optional; do not commit). Run all commands from here.
- **scripts/index.ts** — CLI only; no plugin. Invoke with `npx tsx scripts/index.ts <tool> [params]`; result is the JSON line on stdout.
